Description: GeneRepresentationPackage provides a set of S4 classes for different gene types. 
	These include protein-coding genes, long non-coding RNA genes and microRNA genes.
	They all inherit from a virtual gene class that represents general gene characteristics.
	Each gene object contains comprehensive information, including an ID (e.g., Ensembl ID or NCBI gene ID),
	HUGO symbol, gene name, description, gene structure (represented as a GRanges object with chromosome,
	start, end and strand) and specific gene products (e.g., protein ID and sequence, lncRNA ID and RNA sequence
	or microRNA ID and seed sequence). This structure distinguishes between information common to all genes
	and details unique to specific gene types. Constructor functions and accessor functions provide a user-friendly
	interface for interacting with gene data. The package also includes a class-specific function,
	`lengthProduct(gene)`, which returns the length of a gene's product,
	such as the encoded protein for protein-coding genes, the RNA sequence for lncRNA genes
	or the final miRNA for microRNA genes.
